            <h2>Py3D - Python 3D Renderer</h2>
            <p>
                Py3D is based purely on imaging library Pillow and GUI framework PyQt6. It is capable of rendering with rasterization (~0.02 seconds per frame) or with simple raytracing (~20 seconds per frame). Supports loading and viewing predefined .obj wavefront object files, move and rotate objects with keyboard and mouse. Rendering with lighting for complex objects can be done within milliseconds allowing for a live interactive display.

            <p>
                Future work will be done to optimize rendering speed and adding shadows for multi-object rendering. This may take time because I am still learning along the way, but it is the most fun and rewarding project ever!

            <p>
                Implemented with PyTorch, the convolutional neural net takes a 5x5 map of mines with the center opened
                and outputs a 5x5 probability map representing the probability of every block being a mine.
                The program then opens blocks with a non-mine probability greater than 90%.
            </p>

            <p>
                This solver attempts to open most blocks correctly. Solving a 16x16 map with 40 mines, 
                which performs well on near-center locations. However, it often fails to completely finish the game 
                when encountering edges.
            </p>
            <p>
                The simulation environment is implemented with PyGame in OpenAI Gym style. With the specified dicrete action and observation spaces as well as reward for each action, forming a conventional markov decision process. Other generic ML/RL algorithms may be applied to solve this game. <a href="https://github.com/Jeffreyyao/gym-minesweeper">(Source Code)</a>
