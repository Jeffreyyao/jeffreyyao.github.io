            <p>
                Implemented with PyTorch, the convolutional neural net takes a 5x5 map of mines with the center opened
                and outputs a 5x5 probability map representing the probability of every block being a mine.
                The program then opens blocks with a non-mine probability greater than 90%.
            </p>

            <p>
                This solver attempts to open most blocks correctly. Solving a 16x16 map with 40 mines, 
                which performs well on near-center locations. However, it often fails to completely finish the game 
                when encountering edges.

                The simulation environment is implemented with PyGame in OpenAI Gym style. With the specified dicrete action and observation spaces as well as reward for each action, forming a conventional markov decision process. Other generic ML/RL algorithms may be applied to solve this game. <a href="https://github.com/Jeffreyyao/gym-minesweeper">(Source Code)</a>

            <h2>Glider</h2>
            A glider whose design conforms to aerodynamic principles for ASEN 2004's class project.
            This design has been iterated to maximize flight range and endurance.
